# inmet_brazil

This repository contains code that can be used to obtain and organize Brazil's INMET (National Institute of Meteorology) **daily** historical data from BDMEP (Meteorological database for teaching and research).

This workflow assumes you already know what can be found at BDMEP database and have some idea about what you want. Check: http://www.inmet.gov.br/portal/index.php?r=bdmep/bdmep to explore and understand the data.

The workflow was divided into 3 main steps: 

1-Definition of weather stations of interest;

2-BDMEP login and obtaining the data;

3-Organizing data
